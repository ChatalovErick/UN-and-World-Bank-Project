      "descriptionKey": [
        "The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is calculated by multiplying two values: the [share of people who are multidimensionally poor](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-multi-poverty) and the [intensity of their poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/intensity-of-multidimensional-poverty-national).",
        "Being in multidimensional poverty means that a person lives in a household deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, grouped into three dimensions of well-being: **health** (using two indicators: nutrition, child mortality), **education** (using two indicators: years of schooling, school attendance), and **living standards** (using six indicators: cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets).",
        "Each household is assessed against specific thresholds for these indicators. For example, a household is considered deprived in the _electricity_ indicator if it does not have access to it. [This article](https://ourworldindata.org/multidimensional-poverty-index) discusses specific thresholds in more detail.",
        "Each indicator contributes to one of the three dimensions of well-being.  Health and education indicators are weighted more (1/6 each) than living standards indicators (1/18 each) so that all three dimensions contribute equally to the overall measure.",
        "The intensity of multidimensional poverty is calculated as the average share of indicators in which those counted as MPI poor are deprived.",
        "This indicator is a harmonized over time (HOT) estimate. This harmonization seeks to make two or more MPI estimates comparable by aligning the indicator definitions in each survey. Look for the [current margin estimate (CME)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi) to see the most recent survey data."
